# ON APPARENT PHENOMENOLOGY IN COMPUTABLE SYSTEMS

0. Intersect N-number of binary blobs
1. Claim: (0) produces a novel binary blob
2. In space-time, if (1) holds true, then Monte Carlo/Markov methods can predict the vector-space of novel binary blobs
3. If novel binary blobs exist, then we can apply the computational method from (2) to solve maze problems and find 
useful predicates to solve for the existence of new particles, dark matter and halo-spaces in N-body simulations
4. THEOREM: At the center of a maze problem, there exists a 'minimal mining path' for a given problem space
