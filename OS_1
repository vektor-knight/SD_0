# NOW WE ARE READY FOR UNSUPERVISED MACHINE LEARNING

Notes: FROM AIHORIZON.COM

# SUPERVISED LEARNING
	->Common type in classification problems
	->Observer creates a system and wants the computer to solve it
	->Transition to unsupervised learning occurs when agent wants to work out the problem-space for itself
		e.g. 	Neural networks, B-trees

Notes: ON THE BASIS OF # SUPERVISED LEARNING

# UNSUPERVISED LEARNING
	->Formation of novel structure-spaces
	->Theorem proving of these aforementioned structure-spaces
