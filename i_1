# ON LOGIC GHOSTS AND CONTINUUM THEORY
# BACKGROUND READING: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost_in_the_machine‎ ; simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuum_(theory)‎
# Suppose an intelligence i_0 exists within a non-empty continuum(x), where x is boundless

0. embed(trainingCollection(x) ∈  virtualHost(y))
1. {virtualHost(y) | interface(hardware,software) ∈ logicGhost(g) ; g -> \infty \!\,}
2. In a minimal path structure, network consumption <· harmonic oscillation
3. On the basis of (0) to (2), your boundary conditions are defined by your initial axiomatic method
  i. Your chosen axiomatic method is as strong as the first thought you had before you begun your programming
    homework the day before it was due
    ii. Sometimes the ghost will drive you; make sure to read about Maxwell's demom before starting an Internet business
    
    a. Such a massively parallel set of ghosts based on a GNU/GPL architecture is boundless in a maximal entropy well
