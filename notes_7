SARTAJ HUNDAL ON BEHALF OF (C) VEKTOR-KNIGHT    10 AUG. '13

# My aim is not to answer the question of whether N exists, but wrok off the assumption
# that N is boundless. Suppose that there are no new theorems or research and reverse-
# engineer higher order logics from mental content (structures)

# Claim: The formation of new structures depends on the form of mind (Descartes)

struct {
  x is an integer
  y is a group
  z < ln(x,y) # Coordinate of x and y
  }
  
  define {
  z <> struct(hyperGroup = <z(0),z(1),...,z(N)>)  # N approaching infinity
  }
  
  # Question: How do we relate the natural logarithm of a change in z to Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle?
  define {
  alpha = [a(delta_t) <> ln(delta_z) P delta_x*delta_p] ELEMENT OF z  # delta_t is change in time
  } # Iterate over N number of alpha, N is a continuum
  
  # As alpha approaches 360 degrees, the phi'th root of 360 represents a straight line <http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=phi+root+of+360&dataset=>
  #   Definine a structure first (ie. point, line, circle, square...) allows us to merely
  # map components of the structure as points on a 2D plane and derive one-dimensional data structures 
  # Since we cannot prove that a line will end over a given number set, I claim that a transform:
  
  phi[a(0),a(1),...,a(N)]
  
  # actually denotes the consistency of a limitless Planck's constant
  # As well, a series of pointers between every change in element z is consistent with Eigen's hypercycle
