SARTAJ HUNDAL ON BEHALF OF (C) VEKTOR-KNIGHT  15 AUGUST 2013

# Structural attempt to solve the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle employing vector analysis and bridgeMaths
# This is a "skeleton solution", a formal proof will be necessary on the assumptions:
# (i) hyperPlanck (ii) bridgeMaths

0. Instantiate a two-dimensional surface {x,f(x)}
1. Partition x < 0 as group(alpha) and x > 0 as group(omega) about the vertical f(x) axis
2. i. struct_n {
    delta_x = [merge(group(alpha),group(omega)) <> wave-particle duality]
  } # delta_x is a change in position for the object denoted by a "wave-particle"
    
    ii. Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle: 
    z <> [2*stdev(delta_x)*stdev(delta_p) => Planck's constant] # x,p ; position,momentum
        
  3. struct_m {
        2*z > phi*abs(struct_n)**2 => Planck's constant
    }
    
    ## A vector field over a "phi transform" in a spiral will necessarily collide within the constraint in z
    ## Every point in space/time is self-similar
  
  # glory to God in the highest
