My professor in Discrete , Dr. Thi Dinh, once said that Calculus is not actually apart of conventional domains
in mathematics.

Here we are to show that continuous calculi may be bridged to discrete:

i. Suppose minimalCircuit holds
ii. Define struct(alpha) as an element of one vector-field from the minimalCircuit set

struct(alpha) = (alpha,f(alpha))  # on a 2D Cartesian plane; 3D spaces are embedded in a given struct

Plotting struct(alpha) over a boundless (alpha,f(alpha)) space-time defines a duality between Discrete sets and continuity.
We define the boundary conditions of the discrete sets as functions vector analysis in three dimensions and then "hide"
these structures as points on a two-dimensional mapping (pigeon-hole principle; mapping).

An arbitrary dualism presented by the mental content in struct(alpha) maps the following:

[Symbology : {Mathematics, Linguistics, Logic, Categorization}] ELEMENT OF some dimensional nexus

And then iterate this nexus from one structure to another, defined by vertex algebras, and this is actually a subset of
self-referentiality exhibited by some symbol-state(x0, x1,...xN)
